# DiagnoBridge
Observing my cousin’s struggle with misdiagnosed tumors opened my eyes to the dire need for more accessible, rapid healthcare communication, especially in the Arab community. 

Driven by this realization, I built a mobile-friendly website that currently allows exclusive chats with me—since I own the server—but ultimately aims to connect patients with partner doctors running personalized channels. Late nights and early mornings became my classroom, fueled by one unshakable companion: tea (which, by the way, I find far superior to coffee).

As I dove into countless online tutorials to bolster my Python knowledge, I also conducted user research indicating that people in my region prefer websites over standalone apps for convenience and accessibility. This insight prompted me to shift my strategy, using DHTML for a responsive front end and maintaining Python on the backend for robust handling of image classification APIs. Throughout this intense process, my “purpose notebook” grounded me in the mission of bridging healthcare gaps, while each code error, algorithmic hiccup, and pivot tested my resilience.

Through it all, I’ve come to appreciate how technical expertise and humble perseverance—not to mention a warm cup of tea—can pave the way for meaningful change.
